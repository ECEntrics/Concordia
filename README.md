# Concordia
> A distributed forum using Blockchain, supporting direct democratic voting

## Setup

You can find detailed instructions on how to get started with each service in the respective package directories. The
overall setup pipeline **for development** is this though:

- start rendezvous server and ganache
- migrate contracts
- start application

## Using Docker images

This project provides docker images for a number of services required to set up Concordia, as well as for Concordia
itself.

Check out the README.md in the `./docker` directory
