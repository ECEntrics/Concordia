# About Concordia

## What

Concordia is a forum platform (remember forums? ðŸ¤©) that focuses on user privacy and direct democratic voting. It is a
FOSS distributed via its Gitlab [repository][concordia-repository] and Docker [repository][concordia-docker-hub] under
the [MIT][concordia-license] license.

## Why

Values of privacy and freedom are diminishing in modern software. Even more so in social media software. Users are now
called to decide between being the product of companies that sell their personal information for gain and being shut out
of the modern, digital society.

Concordia, much like other projects of this kind, provides an alternative to this predicament.
