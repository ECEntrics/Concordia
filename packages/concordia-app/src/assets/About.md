# About Concordia

## What

Concordia is a forum platform (remember forums? ðŸ¤©) that focuses on user privacy and direct democratic voting. It is a
FOSS distributed via its Gitlab [repository][concordia-repository] and Docker [repository][concordia-docker-hub] under
the [MIT][concordia-license] license.

## Why

The value of privacy, freedom of speech and democracy are diminishing in modern software. Even more so in social media
platforms. Users are called to select between being the product of companies that sell their personal information and
being shut out of the modern, digital society.

Concordia, much like other projects of this kind, provides an alternative to this predicament.

## How

Concordia uses decentralized technologies, namely the Ethereum blockchain and its smart contracts, as well as the
distributed database OrbitDB that's based on the decentralized network IPFS. These technologies make Concordia
impervious to censorship and guaranty the immutability of user information and anonymity while enabling user
authentication that makes trusted, direct voting possible.

You can read more about the technological stack in Concordia's [whitepaper][concordia-whitepaper].
